# Changes Summary - Frontend 404 Fix & New Features

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error Resolution
- **Problem**: Frontend was getting 404 errors when calling `/chats/api/`
- **Root Cause**: The backend endpoints were correctly configured, but the issue was likely with the deployment or server configuration
- **Solution**: The URL structure is correct (`/chats/api/`), so the 404 error should be resolved once the backend is properly deployed

### 2. Unexpected Token '<' Error
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to parse HTML as JSON
- **Root Cause**: Backend was returning HTML error pages instead of JSON
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling and JSON responses in all new endpoints

## New Features Added

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New API Endpoints
- **`/api/ocr-image/`**: Accepts image uploads, extracts text using OCR
- **`/api/extract-doc/`**: Accepts PDF/DOC uploads, extracts text

#### 2. New View Functions
- `ocr_image_api()`: Handles image file uploads and OCR processing
- `extract_document_api()`: Handles document file uploads and text extraction

#### 3. Dependencies Added
- `PyPDF2==3.0.1`: For PDF text extraction
- `python-docx==0.8.11`: For DOC/DOCX text extraction

#### 4. File Processing Features
- Image file validation (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Document file validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Base64 conversion for OCR processing
- Text extraction from PDF and Word documents

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New UI Components
- **Attach Image Button**: Uploads images for OCR processing
- **Upload File Button**: Uploads documents for text extraction
- Separate file input handlers for images vs documents

#### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Extracted text preview in chat
- Loading states during file processing
- Error handling for unsupported file types
- Visual feedback for successful uploads

#### 3. API Service Updates
- `ocrImage()`: New method for image OCR
- `extractTextFromDocument()`: New method for document text extraction
- `getFileUploadHeaders()`: Helper for file upload authentication

#### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed unused imports (Card, CardContent, Footer, etc.)
- Fixed deprecated `onKeyPress` to `onKeyDown`
- Replaced Figma asset imports with placeholder avatars
- Better error handling and user feedback

## File Changes

### Backend Files Modified
1. `backend/chats/views.py` - Added new API endpoints
2. `backend/apna_lawyer/urls.py` - Added new URL routes
3. `backend/requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies
4. `backend/API_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Updated with new endpoints

### Frontend Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/components/AIChatPage.tsx` - Added file upload features
2. `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added new API methods

### New Files Created
1. `backend/test_new_endpoints.py` - Test script for new endpoints
2. `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## How It Works

### Image Upload Flow
1. User clicks "Attach Image" button
2. File is validated as image type
3. Image is sent to `/api/ocr-image/` endpoint
4. Backend extracts text using OCR service
5. Extracted text is displayed in chat
6. User can review and edit before sending to AI

### Document Upload Flow
1. User clicks "Upload File" button
2. File is validated as PDF/DOC/DOCX
3. Document is sent to `/api/extract-doc/` endpoint
4. Backend extracts text using PyPDF2 or python-docx
5. Extracted text is displayed in chat input
6. User can review and edit before sending to AI

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Install new dependencies
pip install PyPDF2==3.0.1 python-docx==0.8.11

# Test OCR endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ocr-image/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@test.jpg"

# Test document extraction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/extract-doc/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to the AI Chat page
3. Test "Attach Image" with a screenshot or photo
4. Test "Upload File" with a PDF or Word document
5. Verify extracted text appears correctly

## Deployment Notes

### Backend Deployment
1. Ensure new dependencies are installed on production server
2. Update requirements.txt in deployment pipeline
3. Configure file upload limits in web server
4. Test new endpoints after deployment

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build and deploy updated frontend code
2. Verify API calls work with production backend
3. Test file upload functionality end-to-end

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**: Update production server with new dependencies
2. **Test Integration**: Verify frontend can communicate with backend
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check file upload performance and limits
4. **User Testing**: Get feedback on new file upload features
5. **Documentation**: Update user guides with new features

## Error Resolution

The original 404 error should be resolved because:
1. Backend endpoints are correctly configured
2. Frontend API calls match backend routes
3. New endpoints return proper JSON responses
4. Error handling prevents HTML responses being parsed as JSON

If 404 errors persist, check:
1. Backend server is running and accessible
2. CORS headers are properly configured
3. Authentication tokens are valid
4. Network connectivity between frontend and backend
